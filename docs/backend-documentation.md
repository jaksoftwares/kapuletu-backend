KapuLetu Treasury System - Comprehensive Backend Documentation
1. Problem Statement
Community finance groups rely on fragmented tools such as WhatsApp, SMS, spreadsheets, and manual record keeping.
This creates inefficiencies, errors, duplication, lack of auditability, and high treasurer workload.

Key challenges:
- Scattered transaction records
- High risk of missing transactions
- Duplicate entries
- No structured approval workflow
- Weak audit trail
- Poor handling of group contributions
- Reporting fatigue


2. Solution Overview
KapuLetu is an intelligent treasury assistant system designed to:
- Capture transactions automatically
- Structure financial records
- Enable approval workflows
- Maintain immutable ledgers
- Automate reporting


3. Backend Architecture Overview
The backend is designed using a serverless, event-driven architecture.

Core principles:
- Event-driven processing
- Modular services
- Serverless execution
- Strong audit and data integrity


4. AWS Lambda Explanation
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code only when triggered by an event.
It eliminates the need to manage servers.

Flow:
1. Event occurs (e.g., message received)
2. Lambda function executes
3. Function completes and stops

Benefits:
- No server management
- Auto scaling
- Pay per execution


5. End-to-End System Flow
1. User sends payment confirmation via WhatsApp/SMS
2. Twilio forwards message to backend
3. API Gateway triggers ingestion Lambda
4. Message is parsed into structured data
5. Transaction stored as Pending
6. Treasurer reviews via frontend
7. Approval Lambda validates and processes transaction
8. Approved transaction stored in immutable ledger
9. Reporting service generates summaries and exports
